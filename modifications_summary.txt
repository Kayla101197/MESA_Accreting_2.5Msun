The purpose of this model is to evolve a star through the post-AGB phase while applying the accretion of metal-poor gas from a circumbinary disk. Accreted gas produces a phenomenon referred to as chemical depletion, observed in almost all post-AGB stars with a circumbinary disk (see Oomen et al. 2019). 


### MODIFICATIONS ###
The following files must first be modified within the main MESA code. The modified versions of these files, with the changes listed below already implemented, 
are provided in the 'MESA_scripts_modified' folder of the GitHub repository for this work (https://github.com/Kayla101197/MESA_Accreting_2.5Msun.git): 

	1) $MESA_DIR/star_data/public/star_data_step_input.inc  
		-- Extra variables added for accretion from a circumbinary disk
	
	2) $MESA_DIR/star/private/adjust_mass.f90  
		-- Subroutine do_adjust_mass altered to allow simultaneous mass-loss by stellar wind and accretion of 
		   gas with a specified composition
		-- Subroutine set_xa altered to set the outer layers of accreted material to the accreted composition
                -- Important alteration made to timestep dt in 'frac' calculation (line 903): dt must be converted from sec to yrs (i.e., dt/31556952)

	3) $MESA_DIR/star/private/turb_info.f90 
		-- Line added to reduce gradT excess in more massive post-AGB models (CO core + He shell mass > 0.65 Msun) 
 

After modifications, install the changes by running ./install inside the $MESA_DIR directory.


The run_star_extras.f90 file inside your model directory must also be altered to include two new subroutines -- evolve_to_PAGB   and   do_PAGB_evolution 
(see provided run_star_extras.f90 file in this repository). In run_star_extras.f90, you will point s% other_adjust_mdot to these subroutines at different 
points in the star's evolution (details below). The file inlist_project in your model directory will be 'told' to access the other_adjust_mdot subroutines 
stored within the star_info structure.


### RUNNING A MODEL ###
Now you are ready to run a model! Follow these general steps:

	Step 1) Evolve the star toward the RGB/AGB phase:

	- Evolve the model from the pre-MS to the desired post-AGB core mass (CO core + He shell), which is set by the stopping 
          condition he_core_mass_limit in inlist_project.
	- For this step, point s% other_adjust_mdot => evolve_to_PAGB in run_star_extras.f90, so that only a stellar wind 
          is activated.

	Step 2) Evolve the star to the start of the post-AGB phase:

	- Now, we want to evolve the star to the post-AGB phase by removing the remaining envelope mass via stellar winds down 
	  to 0.02 Msun, on a short timescale of ~ 10,000 years.
	- To achieve this, alter the subroutine evolve_to_PAGB in run_star_extras.f90 such that %mass_change = -1d-4.
	- Additionally, set the stopping condition envelope_mass_limit = 0.02 in inlist_project.
	- Continue the evolution for this step from the last photo file output by the model run during Step 1.


	Step 3) Evolve the star through the post-AGB phase, while applying accretion:

	- The star now enters the post-AGB phase. Accretion will begin in the model at a specified Tstart temperature (here, 4000 K), and continue
          until Teff ~ 50,000 K (the hot PN stage).
	- To apply accretion in the model in this way, point s% other_adjust_mdot => do_PAGB_evolution in run_star_extras.f90. Here, you 
          can set the starting accretion rate (Mdot), initial disc mass (Md), and the temperature at which you want to start the accretion (Tstart). 
          More information about these parameters, as well as the disc model, can be found in Oomen et al. (2019).
	- Additionally, set the stopping condition Teff_upper_limit = 5d4 in inlist_project to terminate evolution with accretion at 50,000 K.


### ADDITIONAL NOTES ###
None of the changes to the star_info structure or run_star_extras will apply until s% deplete = .true. in the model. 
To evolve more massive post-AGB stars (~0.65 Msun), set okay_to_reduce_gradT_excess to .true. to avoid convergence 
issues. See Oomen et al. (2019).
