# MESA_Accreting_2.5Msun

Author: Kayla Martin, Master of Research candidate at Macquarie University, Sydney Australia.

Description: 

This repository contains the MESA code (version 22.11.1) to evolve a 2.5 solar mass star of initial solar metallicity through the post-AGB phase, while applying accretion from a circumbinary disk.

The MESA code scripts provided here were initially retrieved from Glenn-Michael Oomen, who had developed the scripts using MESA version 10398 for use in Oomen et al. ([2019](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/09/aa35853-19/aa35853-19.html), [2020](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/10/aa38341-20/aa38341-20.html)). Here, the MESA scripts of Oomen et al. ([2019](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/09/aa35853-19/aa35853-19.html), [2020](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/10/aa38341-20/aa38341-20.html)) have been updated to enable compatibility with a more recent release of MESA (version 22.11.1), and to ensure our physical parameter choices within the model set up remain consistent with the recent literature. 

Please refer to the modifications_summary.txt file for more information on modifications made to the scrips of Oomen et al. ([2019](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/09/aa35853-19/aa35853-19.html), [2020](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/10/aa38341-20/aa38341-20.html)).
