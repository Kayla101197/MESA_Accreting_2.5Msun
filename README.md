Description: 

This repository contains the MESA code (version 22.11.1) to evolve a 2.5Msun star of solar metallicity through the post-AGB phase, while applying accretion from a circumbinary disk.

The MESA code scripts provided here were initially retrieved from Glenn-Michael Oomen, who had developed the scripts using MESA version 10398 for use in Oomen et al. (2019, 2020). Here, the MESA scripts of Oomen et al. (2019, 2020) have been updated to enable compatibility with the most recent release of MESA (version 22.11.1), and to ensure our physical parameter choices within the model set up remain consistent with the most recent literature. 

Please refer to the modifications_summary.txt file for more information on modifications made to the scrips of Oomen et al. (2019, 2020).
