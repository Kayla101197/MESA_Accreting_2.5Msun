**Description:** 

This repository contains the MESA code (version [r22.11.1](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r22.11.1/using_mesa/output.html)) to evolve a $2.5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ star with initial solar-scaled metallicity through the post-AGB phase, while applying time-varying accretion from a circumbinary disk.

The MESA code scripts provided here are modified versions of those retrieved from [Oomen et al. (2019)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/09/aa35853-19/aa35853-19.html), which were originally prepared using an earlier MESA version (i.e., r10398). At present, MESA r22.11.1 (released November 2022) is the most recent, fully-workable version of MESA (latest instrumentation paper accessible via [this link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220803651J)). Importantly, MESA r22.11.1 has undergone a major restructuring from previous version releases, and contains many new features (see [changelog](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r22.11.1/changelog.html)). As such, we have completely updated the MESA scripts from [Oomen et al. (2019)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/09/aa35853-19/aa35853-19.html) to be compatible with MESA r22.11.1, and have further ensured any physical parameter choices used in the model setup are consistent with more recent literature. 

Please refer to the modifications_summary.txt file for a detailed description of the modifications made to the scripts of [Oomen et al. (2019)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/09/aa35853-19/aa35853-19.html).
