**Description:** 

This repository contains the MESA code (version [22.11.1](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..265...15J/abstract)) to evolve a $2.5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ star of initial solar metallicity ($Z=0.02$) through the post-AGB phase, while applying time-varying accretion from a circumbinary disk.

The MESA code scripts provided here were initially retrieved from Glenn-Michael Oomen (see Oomen et al. [2019](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/09/aa35853-19/aa35853-19.html), [2020](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/10/aa38341-20/aa38341-20.html)), developed using MESA version $10398$. The newest version of MESA is $22.11.1$ (latest instrumentation paper viewable at [this link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220803651J)), released in November 2022. MESA $22.11.1$ has undergone some major restructural changes and contains many new features (see [changelog](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r22.11.1/changelog.html)). As such, we have largely updated the MESA scripts of Oomen et al. ([2019](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/09/aa35853-19/aa35853-19.html), [2020](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/10/aa38341-20/aa38341-20.html)) to enable compatibility with the most recent release of MESA, and to ensure our physical parameter choices within the model set up remain consistent with more recent literature. 

Please refer to the modifications_summary.txt file for more information on modifications made to the scrips of Oomen et al. ([2019](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/09/aa35853-19/aa35853-19.html), [2020](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2020/10/aa38341-20/aa38341-20.html)).
