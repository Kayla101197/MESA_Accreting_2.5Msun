This directory contains the modified MESA files to run a star of initial mass 2.5 Msun, with solar-scaled metallicity,
from the MS to WD phase. During the post-AGB phase of evolution, accretion of gas (of specified chemical composition) 
from a circumbinary disk may be enabled by the user (initial accretion rate and initial disk mass are set by the user). 

See 'modifications_summary.txt' file in the GitHub repository for a detailed description of each file's use.
